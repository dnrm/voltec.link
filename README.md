This is FRC team 6647's URL Shortener.

## How it works

This URL shortener is built with NextJS, MongoDB, ReactJS, and Vercel. It is an application that will allow the team to shorten URLs for use in social media posts, presentations, and other places where a URL is needed. The application is hosted on Vercel, and the database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
